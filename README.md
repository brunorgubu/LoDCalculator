# LoDCalculator

## Overview
LoDCalculator is a Blender add-on designed to analyze the level of detail (LoD) of 3D models. It evaluates geometric and radiometric fidelity, providing scores and raw data that help assess the quality of your models.

## Installation

1. **Download** the `LoDCalculator.py` file from this repository.
2. **Open Blender** and navigate to the Preferences menu.
3. Go to the **Add-ons** section.
4. Click on **Install from local disk** and select the downloaded `.py` file.
5. The add-on is now installed and a new section called **LoDCalculator** will appear in the Scene Properties panel.

## Usage

1. **Select a 3D Model**: Choose the model you want to analyze in the Blender viewport.
2. **Analyze the Model**: Click the **Calculate Result** button in the LoDCalculator panel.
3. **Review Results**: The results will display the LoD score and analysis data. If there are issues (e.g., no model selected, non-mesh object, or model without textures), an error notification will appear, and the analysis will receive the lowest possible score.

### Scoring System
- **LoD Score**: Ranges from 1 to 5, with half-point divisions, evaluating the overall model quality.
- **Partial Scores**:
  - **Geometric Fidelity**: Ranges from 1 to 3, assessing the geometric detail of the model.
  - **Radiometric Fidelity**: Ranges from 1 to 3, evaluating textures and materials.

### Analysis Data
When an analysis is executed, you can view:
- **Raw Data**: Including the last interquartile range and average angles of the model's faces.
- **Model Statistics**: Number of faces and meshes, average faces per mesh, number of textures and materials, average resolution of textures, and percentage of tiled faces.

### Relative Data Comparison
LoDCalculator can compare models of different scales, whether they consist of a single mesh or multiple complex meshes.

### Examples
Usage examples with their corresponding scores will be provided to illustrate the capabilities of LoDCalculator.

## Uninstallation
To uninstall LoDCalculator:
1. Go back to Blender's Preferences.
2. Navigate to the Add-ons section.
3. Click on **Uninstall** for LoDCalculator.
